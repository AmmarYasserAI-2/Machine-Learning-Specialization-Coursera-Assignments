##  How to Use

* Each numbered folder contains Jupyter notebooks with assignments, plus quiz notes.
* Clone the repository and explore notebooks under each course for implementation details and results.

* The **Lunar Lander** project (inside the Reinforcement Learning folder) demonstrates how I trained an agent using **Q-Learning** to land a spacecraft in the [OpenAI Gym](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/lunar_lander/) simulation environment.
    * I implemented a custom reward system to guide the learning.
    * The episodes took a long time to converge â€” but it worked.
    * Below is a sample of the learning curve and a video of the final agent landing.
